# laaS-AWS-ImageRecognitionAsAService
In the first project, we will build an elastic application that can automatically scale out and in on-demand and cost-effectively by using the IaaS cloud. Our cloud app will provide an image recognition service to users, by using cloud resources to perform deep learning on images provided by the users.
